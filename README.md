<p id="description">Embarking on this project during my second year for the Object-Oriented Programming Module, we crafted an Online Tour Guide System to explore the realms of Java and database management. 🗺️</p>

<h2>💻 Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   **mySQL:** Serving as the robust database management system, ensuring structured storage of tour-related information. 🗃️

*   **Java:** The driving force behind our application, providing a powerful and object-oriented foundation for seamless functionality. ☕

This project not only deepened our understanding of object-oriented principles but also allowed us to apply them practically in developing a user-friendly and efficient online tour guide system. 🌐
